## Why I Built This

Building **KoalaSEC Blog** allowed me to solidify core concepts in PHP development and dive into the hands-on application of:

- Writing secure, maintainable PHP code
- Structuring applications with reusable components for ease of scaling
- Working with MySQL for efficient data querying and management
- Designing interactive and visually engaging web interfaces

## Tech Stack
